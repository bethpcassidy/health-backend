# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Doctor.create(Name: "Dr. Stevens Smith")

# Patient.create(Name: "Jackie Donohugh")

# Appointment.create(headline: "Checkup", message: "test message", approved: 0, date: "01/01/2023")
